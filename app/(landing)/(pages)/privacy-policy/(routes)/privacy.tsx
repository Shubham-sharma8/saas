<strong>What Information Do We Collect </strong><br/><br/>

Indirectly, through automated technologies such as cookies, or from third parties.
On behalf of our Customers, when we process the personal data of their End Users as part of our Services. <br/><br/>

This is all explained in more detail below. <br/><br/>


<strong>Information We Collect Directly From You </strong><br/><br/> 
You can generally visit our Site without having to submit any personal information. If you request more information, or sign up for our Services, we will collect personal information as follows. <br/><br/>
<strong>Account Information. </strong><br/><br/>
When you register for a Cogify customer account (including when you join for free) we request your email address and, on occasion, your telephone number. Once your email and telephone number have been confirmed by our systems and you have successfully signed up, we will ask you to create a username and optionally upload a profile picture. We also provide you the option of submitting your name, company name and location. This information is your &quot;Account Information&quot; for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Account Information is required to identify you as a Customer and permit you to access your account(s). By voluntarily providing us with such Account Information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal data or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us. <br/><br/>
<strong>Customer Payment Information. </strong><br/><br/>
You are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on which billing method you choose. In order to process your payment Information, we use PCI-compliant third-party processors, as explained in the Section on &quot;Payment Processing&quot; below. This information is processed by our payment service provider and we receive a confirmation of payment, which we then associate with your Account Information and any relevant transactions. <br/><br/>
<strong>Optional Information. </strong><br/><br/>
We may also ask you to submit personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Platform, including participation in surveys, promotions, requesting customer support, or otherwise communicating with us. <br/><br/>

<strong>Information from Third Parties </strong><br/><br/>
As of now instances, we don&apos;t process process personal information from third parties, which consists of data from our partners, such as transactional data from providers of payment services, or information from third parties.

For example, we may combine information entered through a Cogify sales submission with information we receive from a third-party sales intelligence platform to enhance our ability to market our Services to Customers or potential Customers. <br/><br/>




<strong>Payment Processing </strong><br/><br/>
We do not directly collect your payment information and we do not store your payment information. We use third-party, PCI-compliant, payment processors, which collect payment information on our behalf in order to complete transactions.

Note that if we receive information that provides us with a good faith belief that there is an exigent emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, we may provide information to law enforcement trying to prevent or mitigate the danger (if we have it), to be determined on a case-by-case basis. <br/><br/>

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Platform. The Platform may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Cogify (&quot;Third Party Sites&quot;).

<strong>How Long Do We Keep Your Personal information? </strong><br/><br/> <br/><br/> 


<strong>General Retention Periods </strong><br/><br/>
We use the following criteria to determine our retention periods: <br/><br/>
The amount, nature and sensitivity of your information; <br/><br/>
The reasons for which we collect and process the personal data; <br/><br/>
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide you with access to our Platform; and <br/><br/>
applicable legal requirements. <br/><br/>
We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide our Services. Note, however, that with respect to our Customers with active accounts, we may retain certain essential account information, but otherwise regularly delete other information that is less essential to the provision of our Services in order to minimize our storage of data.We also will retain personal information that we&apos;ve collected from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). Additionally, we cannot delete information when it is needed for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (also known as a &quot;litigation hold&quot;). In this case, the information must be retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims.When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.For any questions about data retention, please contact privacy@Cogify.com. <br/><br/>

<strong>Anonymization </strong><br/><br/>
In some instances, we may choose to anonymize your personal data instead of deleting it, for statistical use, for instance. When we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the personal data can be linked back to you or any specific user.

<strong>Data Security And Integrity </strong><br/><br/>
We take steps that are reasonably necessary to securely provide our Platform. We have put in place reasonably appropriate security measures designed to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. We limit access to personal data only to those employees, agents, contractors and the third parties who have a business need-to-know. <br/><br/>
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. If required, we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach. We also require those parties to whom we transfer your personal information to provide acceptable standards of security. <br/><br/>
Notwithstanding, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. For any questions about the security of your information, please contact mail. <br/><br/>

<strong>Your California Privacy Rights </strong> <br/><br/>

Customers also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at https://Cogify.com. We ask that Customers use this option as a first step when rectifying information. <br/><br/>

If you do so, we will promptly update our databases, and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing our Services. <br/><br/>
Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence.
